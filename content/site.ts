  narratives: {
    shared: `Every great love story begins with a moment — and theirs started with a simple Facebook message.

"Magandang gabi sa isang magandang dilag."

Those were the first words Kenneth sent Rena. Just one line, yet enough to spark a connection neither of them expected.

From that night on, messages blossomed into deep conversations, and soon, distance became nothing. From Batangas to North Caloocan, Kenneth traveled back and forth — to court her, to know her, to show her she was worth every mile, every hour, every effort.

Years filled with laughter, stories, and travels- their love grew stronger with time. With a heart full of certainty, Kenneth knelt and asked Rena to be his forever. She said yes, sealing a promise of a lifetime.

Now, they stand on the brink of their most beautiful chapter yet.

On January 8, 2026, they will say "I do."`,
